## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out this repo [covid-tracker-Webapp](https://github.com/beharavenkatasatyaprasad/covid-tracker-Webapp).

## The Webapp

This app is to integrate myself with the [Covid API](https://corona.lmao.ninja/docs/) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

I have used any JavaScript on the front-end to develop this particular Webapp.

Users are able to:

- See all countries data from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by continent
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

Want some support on the making such Webapps? feel free to [Ping me](https://wa.me/917093657303?text=Hello%20Satya) and ask questions.
